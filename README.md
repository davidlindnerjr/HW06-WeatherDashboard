# HW06-WeatherDashboard

This project is a basic weather application. You can search any city and the application will give you temperature, wind speed, uv index, and the humidity for the current day. The application will also display the weather and humidity for the following 5-days of the searched city. The last searched city will be saved in local stoarge for the user to see when the application is relaoded (when the application is first opened/used there will not be any city or stats displayed). While in use, the application will save the search history of the previous searched cities and can be clicked to look at those cities again. 

This project was the toughest one yet, it took several days to complete. The part that stumped me the most was after the user searches a city then a button is made on the left hand side to go back to the previous city (The "search history" function). It took hours to find out how to access the id of a dynamically created button where I would have no idea what the id would be called. Once I found the trick on stack overflow it was smooth sailing. I learned a lot about APIs and API keys and I have come to find that they are extremely useful. All in all, this was a fun project and I am happy with how it turned out.
